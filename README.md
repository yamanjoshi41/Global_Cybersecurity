Global Cybersecurity Threats Analysis (2015-2024)
Overview

This project analyzes global cybersecurity threats from 2015 to 2024, examining patterns in financial losses, affected users, attack types, geographic distribution, and defense mechanisms. The analysis provides insights into the evolving cybersecurity landscape over the past decade.

Features

Yearly Trends: Visualizations showing financial losses, affected users, and resolution times over time
Geographic Analysis: Country-specific attack frequencies and financial impacts with interactive choropleth maps
Attack Type Analysis: Distribution of different cyberattack types and their financial consequences
Industry Heatmaps: Relationship between target industries and attack types
3D Visualizations: Interactive 3D plots exploring the relationship between financial loss, affected users, and resolution time
Key Findings

Temporal Trends:
Financial losses peaked in 2022 ($16.8B total) before declining slightly
Number of affected users has steadily increased, reaching 1.2B in 2024
Resolution times improved from 45 hours (2015) to 32 hours (2024)
Geographic Patterns:
Most attacked countries: India (312), China (298), USA (285)
Russia shows high attack frequency but relatively lower financial impact
Attack Characteristics:
Clear patterns in which attack types target specific industries
Significant variation in financial impact and resolution times across attack types
